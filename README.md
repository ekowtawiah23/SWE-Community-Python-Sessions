# SWE Community Python Sessions 🐍

Welcome to the **SWE Community Python Sessions** repository! This repository contains all the code examples, projects, and exercises covered during our online Python programming sessions.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a learning resource for community members participating in our Python programming sessions. All code written during live sessions is uploaded here for you to review, practice, and learn from at your own pace.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

├── README.md           # This file

    └── banking-system.py  # Banking system demonstrating OOP concepts
```

## 📖 What's Inside

### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **banking-system.py**: A practical banking system example demonstrating core OOP principles:
  - **Encapsulation**: Private balance attribute with controlled access
  - **Abstraction**: Simple deposit/withdraw methods hiding implementation details
  - **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Coming in future sessions (SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- Git installed (for cloning the repository)
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)

### How to Clone This Repository

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**

2. **Navigate to where you want to store the project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/projects
   ```

3. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kkbaidu/SWE-Community-Python-Sessions.git
   ```

4. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SWE-Community-Python-Sessions
   ```

### How to Practice

#### Method 1: Run the Examples
```bash
# Navigate to a specific folder
cd OOP

# Run a Python file
python banking-system.py
```

#### Method 2: Experiment with the Code
1. Open the Python files in your code editor
2. Read through the code and comments
3. Try modifying values and see what happens
4. Add your own features or methods
5. Break things and fix them - that's how you learn!

#### Method 3: Create Your Own Versions
1. Copy an example file
2. Rename it (e.g., `my-banking-system.py`)
3. Implement your own ideas
4. Challenge yourself to add new features

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Run the code first** - See what it does before diving deep
- **Read the comments** - They explain key concepts
- **Experiment freely** - Don't be afraid to break things
- **Practice regularly** - Consistency is key to mastering programming
- **Ask questions** - Reach out to the community if you're stuck
